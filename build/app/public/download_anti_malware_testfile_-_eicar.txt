    Anti Malware Testfile


      Intended use

*Additional notes:*

 1. This file used to be named ducklin.htm or ducklin-html.htm or
    similar based on its original author Paul Ducklin and was made in
    cooperation with CARO.
 2. The definition of the file has been refined 1 May 2003 by Eddy
    Willems in cooperation with all vendors.
 3. The content of this documentation (title-only) was adapted 1
    September 2006 to add verification of the activity of anti-malware
    or anti-spyware products. It was decided not to change the file
    itself for backward-compatibility reasons.

*Who needs the Anti-Malware Testfile*

/(read the complete text, it contains important information)
Version of 7 September 2006 /

If you are active in the anti-virus research field, then you will
regularly receive requests for virus samples. Some requests are easy to
deal with: they come from fellow-researchers whom you know well, and
whom you trust. Using strong encryption, you can send them what they
have asked for by almost any medium (including across the Internet)
without any real risk.

Other requests come from people you have never heard from before. There
are relatively few laws (though some countries do have them) preventing
the secure exchange of viruses between consenting individuals, though it
is clearly irresponsible for you simply to make viruses available to
anyone who asks. Your best response to a request from an unknown person
is simply to decline politely.

A third set of requests come from exactly the people you might think
would be least likely to want viruses „users of anti-virus
software“. They want some way of checking that they have deployed their
software correctly, or of deliberately generating a „virus incident in
order to test their corporate procedures, or of showing others in the
organisation what they would see if they were hit by a virus“.
*
Reasons for testing anti-virus software*

Obviously, there is considerable intellectual justification for testing
anti-virus software against real viruses. If you are an anti-virus
vendor, then you do this (or should do it!) before every release of your
product, in order to ensure that it really works. However, you do not
(or should not!) perform your tests in a „real“ environment. You use (or
should use!) a secure, controlled and independent laboratory environment
within which your virus collection is maintained.

Using real viruses for testing in the real world is rather like setting
fire to the dustbin in your office to see whether the smoke detector is
working. Such a test will give meaningful results, but with unappealing,
unacceptable risks.

Since it is unacceptable for you to send out real viruses for test or
demonstration purposes, you need a file that can safely be passed around
and which is obviously non-viral, but which your anti-virus software
will react to as if it were a virus.

If your test file is a program, then it should also produce sensible
results if it is executed. Also, because you probably want to avoid
shipping a pseudo-viral file along with your anti-virus product, your
test file should be short and simple, so that your customers can easily
create copies of it for themselves.

The good news is that such a test file already exists. A number of
anti-virus researchers have already worked together to produce a file
that their (and many other) products „detect“ as if it were a virus.

Agreeing on one file for such purposes simplifies matters for users: in
the past, most vendors had their own pseudo-viral test files which their
product would react to, but which other products would ignore.
*
The Anti-Malware Testfile*

This test file has been provided to EICAR for distribution as the „EICAR
Standard Anti-Virus Test File“, and it satisfies all the criteria listed
above. It is safe to pass around, because it is not a virus, and does
not include any fragments of viral code. Most products react to it as if
it were a virus (though they typically report it with an obvious name,
such as „EICAR-AV-Test“).

The file is a legitimate DOS program, and produces sensible results when
run (it prints the message „EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!“).

It is also short and simple – in fact, it consists entirely of printable
ASCII characters, so that it can easily be created with a regular text
editor. Any anti-virus product that supports the EICAR test file should
detect it in any file providing that the file starts with the following
68 characters, and is exactly 68 bytes long:

X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

The first 68 characters is the known string. It may be optionally
appended by any combination of whitespace characters with the total file
length not exceeding 128 characters. The only whitespace characters
allowed are the space character, tab, LF, CR, CTRL-Z. To keep things
simple the file uses only upper case letters, digits and punctuation
marks, and does not include spaces. The only thing to watch out for when
typing in the test file is that the third character is the capital
letter „O“, not the digit zero.

You are encouraged to make use of the EICAR test file. If you are aware
of people who are looking for real viruses „for test purposes“, bring
the test file to their attention. If you are aware of people who are
discussing the possibility of an industry-standard test file, tell them
about www.eicar.org, and point them at this article.


      Download Anti Malware Testfile

In order to facilitate various scenarios, we provide 4 files for
download. The first, eicar.com, contains the ASCII string as described
above. The second file, eicar.com.txt, is a copy of this file with a
different filename. Some readers reported problems when downloading the
first file, which can be circumvented when using the second version.
Just download and rename the file to „eicar.com“. That will do the
trick. The third version contains the test file inside a zip archive. A
good anti-virus scanner will spot a ‚virus‘ inside an archive. The last
version is a zip archive containing the third file. This file can be
used to see whether the virus scanner checks archives more than only one
level deep.

Once downloaded run your AV scanner. It should detect at least the file
„eicar.com“. Good scanners will detect the ‚virus‘ in the single zip
archive and may be even in the double zip archive. Once detected the
scanner might not allow you any access to the file(s) anymore. You might
not even be allowed by the scanner to delete these files. This is caused
by the scanner which puts the file into quarantaine. The test file will
be treated just like any other real virus infected file. Read the user’s
manual of your AV scanner what to do or contact the vendor/manufacturer
of your AV scanner.

*IMPORTANT NOTE*
EICAR cannot be held responsible when these files or your AV scanner in
combination with these files cause any damage to your computer. *YOU
DOWNLOAD THESE FILES AT YOUR OWN RISK. * Download these files only if
you are sufficiently secure in the usage of your AV scanner. EICAR
cannot and will not provide any help to remove these files from your
computer. Please contact the manufacturer/vendor of your AV scanner to
seek such help.

*How to delete the test file from your PC*

We understand (from the many emails we receive) that it might be
difficult for you to delete the test file from your PC. After all, your
scanner believes it is a virus infected file and does not allow you to
access it anymore. At this point we must refer to our standard answer
concerning support for the test file. We are sorry to tell you that
EICAR cannot and will not provide AV scanner specific support. The best
source to get such information from is the vendor of the tool which you
purchased.

Please contact the support people of your vendor. They have the required
expertise to help you in the usage of the tool. Needless to say that you
should have read the user’s manual first before contacting them.
